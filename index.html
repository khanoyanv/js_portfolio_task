                    <strong>Chat:</strong> Created chat with C language as my final exam of computer architecture block. Many users could connect to server and send messages either to all connected users by tagging someone if they needed to, or send a message directly to some concrete user by writing user's name.

                    <strong>Map:</strong> Created a map application that worked offline, you could add various objects (poligons, lines, squares, etc.) but in order to do that you should have had an acces to internet.

                    <strong>Beer shop:</strong> Created a beer shop's web page as I applied for a job and it was my technical task, you could add beers to your cart, remove them, increase or decrease count of added beers. Each beer had it separate page, containing it's description, price and image. There was a search and filter system as well.
